 # Python language introduction

Python is a general perpose language and it is easy like english language high level language used for machine learning ,web projects,AI and many other technologies #it have many build in libraries

# Python 3 basicss 
used for many applications #contains variable,data types,operators,data flow statements with extra features

# Python The new generation language

Python is widely used language due to its simplicity for scientific computing, data analysis, AI, web development, machine learning.
It has a number of features like interpreted,plateform independent,high level language,free and open source,easy to learn,scripting language,and build in library functions.

# What is Python3.0 and why we do programming?

It is an interpreted language which mean that everyone can read and execute the code
as it is used for developing websites,data analysis,data visualization and task automation which are used in programming

# Why Python is leading edge?

it is easy to learn having simplified syntax
free to use, large ecosystem of libraries and so beginers prefer to learn this language. 

# Whats the major difference between Python2.x and 3.x ?

Python 2 have more complicated syntax than python 3
libraries created by Python3 are more compatible to python3 which is not happened in Python2
Division operator
so difference occours in:

print function

Unicode

xrange

Error Handling

future module

# What is namespace:
these have a unique name for each object in Python. (variable or a method), Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary. 

# Types of namespaces :

 The built-in namespace encompasses
the global namespace and
the global namespace encompasses the local namespace.
